## Introduction

This repository serves as a personal journal and a showcase of my journey into React.js. Here, you'll find various projects, notes, and resources that I've used and created along the way.

## Goals

1. **Understand the basics of React.js**: Learn about components, state, and props.
2. **Build small projects**: Create simple applications to apply what I've learned.
3. **Explore advanced topics**: Dive into hooks, context API, and performance optimization.
4. **Contribute to open source**: Get involved in the React.js community by contributing to projects.

## Resources

Here are some of the resources I'm using to learn React.js:

- [Official React Documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html)
- [React for Beginners by Wes Bos](https://reactforbeginners.com/)

## Projects

As I progress, I'll be adding my projects here:

1. **Simple Todo App**: A basic todo list application to understand state and props.
2. **Weather App**: Fetches weather data from an API and displays it.
3. **Blog Platform**: A small blog platform using React Router and context API.
4. **E-commerce Site**: A mock e-commerce site to practice state management and hooks.
